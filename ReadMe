This is the repository for the group 29 project.
This version of our checkers project does not currently implement the rules of checkers, any checker is able to move to any square
  and there is order which the teams have to move. Any team can move at any time, and when a checker does get captured it has to be
  removed from the board by hand.
Checkers are moved by clicking on it and then clicking on the square that you want to move it to.
We hope to implement the rules in the next two weeks, and therby implement an AI as well.

To run it: javac CheckersGame.java
           java CheckersGame
