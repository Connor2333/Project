This repository is about the group 29 project.
This is currently a text-based version of checkers designed as a two player game with plans to incorporate AI with various
  difficulties and playable in a GUI.
 The rules of the game are the standard checkers rules, with red team starting and the checkers only being able to move diagonally.
In order to capture an opposing checker, an open space must be available behind that checker. This continues until all checkers on
  one side are captured, or until one team has no more valid moves( which results in a loss for that team)
In order to currently play, one must select a checker using its x and y coordinates, and moving it to a valid position using the
  same coordinate system.
